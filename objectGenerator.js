// The object generation algorithm receives 2 inputs: ​rootKeyCount​, and maxDepth
// For each random key in the object, it should randomly decide to make it a number, string, object, boolean, or array
// ● If it is an object, an object will have half the amount of keys as its parent (floored value)
// ● Numbers and strings can be random of any length, upto 20 characters
// ● Arrays should simply be empty
// ■ Your objects should not have more than ​maxDepth​ amount of nesting.
// i.e. if ​maxDepth​ is 2, you can not have more than 2 levels of nested objects
